 Description:
 This programme calculates annual income from user's defined wage and hours, and prints a table showing 
 pay for different periods of time: day, week, month, quarter, year. Future versions will allow for a
 range of wages and hours to be defined, including basic tax/accounting functionality.
 In the meantime, here are the formul√¶ used for calculating pay rate.
 
 daily: wage*hours
 weekly: wage*hours*workdays
 monthly: wage*hours*workdays*weeks
 quarterly: wage*hours*workdays*weeks*months*4
 yearly: wage*hours*workdays*weeks*months*12
 
 Example wagetable($15 per hour, part-time(4 hour workday)):
